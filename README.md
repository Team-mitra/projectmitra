 I hereby declare that project is not a mere imitation or plagiarism of already existing project by a completely unique idea thoroughly thought 
 and searched upon for execution.This is a open source document **GNU General public license,version 2**
 
 
 **Principles , Values and Tools**
 
 THe developers of the idea and websites have agreed upon a certain key "values" to characterize the cculture and approach of **PROJECT:"MITRA"**
 development.In this work the team has developed it's own guiding maxims that roughly map to these values.
 
 Enphasis on individual over benefit of economism.
 ---
 Emphasis on benefit of a group over an individual.
 ---
 Emphasis Identity security and monetary security.
 ---
 Emphasis on community growth for overall growth.
 ---
 Emphasis on execution of fundemental rights and human rights.
 ---
 Emphasis on realism over utopian idealism.
 ---
 Emphasis on individual freedom on chosen ethinic, sexual and cultural identity.

 The flags that are not part of **PROJECT: MITRA**
  
  - Nobody on the software development team is talking with and observing the users of the
 software in action; we mean the actual users of the actual code. (The Program
 Executive Office (PEO) does not count as an actual user, nor does the commanding
 officer, unless she uses the code.)
 
 
 - Continuous feedback from users to the development team (bug reports, users
 assessments) is not available. Talking once at the beginning of a program to verify
 requirements doesn’t count!


 - Meeting requirements is treated as more important than getting something useful into
 the field as quickly as possible.
 
 - Stakeholders (development, test, ops, security, contracting, contractors, end-users,
 etc.)2 are acting more-or-less autonomously.
 
 - End users of the software are missing-in-action throughout development; at a minimum
 they should be present during Release Planning and User Acceptance Testing.
 
 - Development-operations culture is lacking if manual processes are tolerated when such processes
 can and should be automated .
 
 - Some current, common tools in use by teams using agile development (these will change as
better tools become available):

 - Git, ClearCase, or Subversion - version control system for tracking changes to source
 code. Git is the de facto open-source standard for modern software development.

 - BitBucket or GitHub - repository hosting sites. Also provide issues tracking, continuous
 integration “apps” and other productivity tools. Widely used by the open source
 community.
 
 - For the implementation of websites we are using hosting widely integrated hosting sites which
 manage cookies and the implementation of the cookie policy of the hosting website would be the de
 facto policy of the project in itself.
 
- Chef, Ansible, or Puppet - software for writing system configuration "recipes" and
streamlining the task of configuring and maintaining a collection of servers.

- Docker - computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as
"containerization". The utilization of dockers for the app integration as in the future scope of project
is well validated and integrated by the team of developers from the dawn of project.

- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for Container orchestration.

- Jira or Pivotal Tracker - issues reporting, tracking, and management.
 
- The future implementation of the project is to integrate the project in a much easier yet power way
of having a graphical user interface upon multiple configurations and platforms ranging in different
versions minimizing the data and infrastructural challenges for free flow of websites irrespective of
the hosting servers.

**SOME QUESTIONIER ABOUT PROJECT:MITRA**
**Program Mangement**

1. How many programmers are part of organizations that owns the budget and mile stones for the
program.

Ans: There are currently eight members who are the main and integrated part of Project – Mitra.
We are planning to build this number with skillful volunteers and funders. We are currently
looking forward for the collaboration with Ministry of Human Resource development and local
government schools and education facilities. Our current idea would require our collaborations
with NGOs contributing in the field of educative development.

2. What are your management metrics for development and operations; how are they used to
inform priorities, detect problems; how often are they accessed and used by leadership?

Ans: Our key priorities are based on the asserted key value and the evaluation is real time and
peer valued to give no scope for mis management and under commitment towards the cause.

3. What have you learned in your past three days of hackathon and what did you do about it?

Ans: This particular hackathon is a tool for us to represent the student and educative community
globally about the possibilities involved in shaping futures. It is a pulpit of the sacred cause of
our project Mitra.

4. Who are the users that you deliver value to each part of the project? Can we talk to them?

Ans: The creator of the project are the primary volunteers for the cause. The mentioned 8 mails
in the primary documentation for the project are the immediate contact responders and we will
make sure that your voices are heard and well represented.


**Programming Teams**
---
1. How do you test your code?

Ans: We test our code mostly with the tools mentioned in the graphical version. But our get to
go always remains [visit website](selenium.dev)

2. How automated are your development, testing, security, and deployment?

Ans:  Our project is mostly a manual job with needs real time work but for the automation of our
web developed projects in the future scope, we are working with IBM Rational Functional
Tester.

3. Who are your users and how are you interacting with them?

Ans: We are in peer-to-peer interaction with the current small group of beneficiaries and users
but as the future scope yet again we are opting for an integration with Statistical Package For
the Social Science for accurate estimates and deep view of the statistical metrics.

4. What is your (current and future) cycle time for releases to your users?
 
Ans: This is a basic version online platform for the current work we have been working on. We
are looking for more automatic and statically accurate websites with real time interaction and
advance detection and security with a self-build hosting platform.

Program Leadership

1.Are teams delivering working software to at least some subset of real users every iteration
(including the first) and gathering feedback?

Ans: Yes, this testing version of remote hosted website activity is being monitories with a peer
interaction with real time users representing a testing set of the education community.

2. Is there a product charter that lays out the mission and strategic goals? Do all members of
the team understand both, and are they able to see how their work contributes to both?

Ans: Our team also act as the management along with being the developers of strategy. Thus it
is obvious that the strategic goals are the one that both the practical development and
strategical implementation agree upon.

3. Are teams empowered to change the requirements based on user feedback?

Ans: We are in a close-knit connection with the users cause the users being our friends, people
in our neighborhood or the members of the same community. We are united to represent “The
community of Education”. So, every development would base on the greater good of communal
wellbeing.
