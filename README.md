 I hereby declare that project is not a mere imitation or plagiarism of already existing project by a completely unique idea thoroughly thought 
 and searched upon for execution.This is a open source document **GNU General public license,version 2**
 
 
 **Principles , Values and Tools**
 
 THe developers of the idea and websites have agreed upon a certain key "values" to characterize the cculture and approach of **PROJECT:"MITRA"**
 development.In this work the team has developed it's own guiding maxims that roughly map to these values.
 
 Enphasis on individual over benefit of economism.
 ---
 Emphasis on benefit of a group over an individual.
 ---
 Emphasis Identity security and monetary security.
 ---
 Emphasis on community growth for overall growth.
 ---
 Emphasis on execution of fundemental rights and human rights.
 ---
 Emphasis on realism over utopian idealism.
 ---
 Emphasis on individual freedom on chosen ethinic, sexual and cultural identity.

 The flags that are not part of **PROJECT: MITRA**
  
  - Nobody on the software development team is talking with and observing the users of the
 software in action; we mean the actual users of the actual code. (The Program
 Executive Office (PEO) does not count as an actual user, nor does the commanding
 officer, unless she uses the code.)
 
 
 - Continuous feedback from users to the development team (bug reports, users
 assessments) is not available. Talking once at the beginning of a program to verify
 requirements doesn’t count!


 - Meeting requirements is treated as more important than getting something useful into
 the field as quickly as possible.
 
 - Stakeholders (development, test, ops, security, contracting, contractors, end-users,
 etc.)2 are acting more-or-less autonomously.
 
 - End users of the software are missing-in-action throughout development; at a minimum
 they should be present during Release Planning and User Acceptance Testing.
 
 - Development-operations culture is lacking if manual processes are tolerated when such processes
 can and should be automated .
 
 - Some current, common tools in use by teams using agile development (these will change as
better tools become available):

 - Git, ClearCase, or Subversion - version control system for tracking changes to source
 code. Git is the de facto open-source standard for modern software development.

 - BitBucket or GitHub - repository hosting sites. Also provide issues tracking, continuous
 integration “apps” and other productivity tools. Widely used by the open source
 community.
 
 - For the implementation of websites we are using hosting widely integrated hosting sites which
 manage cookies and the implementation of the cookie policy of the hosting website would be the de
 facto policy of the project in itself.
 
- Chef, Ansible, or Puppet - software for writing system configuration "recipes" and
streamlining the task of configuring and maintaining a collection of servers.

- Docker - computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as
"containerization". The utilization of dockers for the app integration as in the future scope of project
is well validated and integrated by the team of developers from the dawn of project.

- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for Container orchestration.

- Jira or Pivotal Tracker - issues reporting, tracking, and management.
 
- The future implementation of the project is to integrate the project in a much easier yet power way
of having a graphical user interface upon multiple configurations and platforms ranging in different
versions minimizing the data and infrastructural challenges for free flow of websites irrespective of
the hosting servers.
